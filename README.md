# SpeechSynth
A text-to-speech synth app developed to assist kids with non-verbal autism. Developed in Vanilla Javascript, using the experimental Web Speech API's SpeechSynthesis interface. Comes with some prebuilt voice templates &amp; also the ability to add custom text.

Might add the ability to add custom voice templates to the list & save it to LocalStorage in future.
